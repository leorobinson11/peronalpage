        "text": "In my stellar nebular simulation I use a method called the Fastmultipole method (FMM) to speed up the calculation of the N-Body pairwise interactions. In FMM a quadtree is used to partition the space depending particle densities of the specific area. By approxiamting the force on a particle via local tailorexpansion of all of the multipole moments of the quadtree nodes the calculation only takes linear logarithmic time.  To calculate the bodies trajectories I used synchronized leapfrog integration.",

A classical model is used to approximate the internal forces as the sum of the bonded interactions (Single Bond, tosion, out of plane) aswell as the non bonded interaction (Van der Wall and electrostatic). At the beginning of the simulation the xyz input file is converted to a undirected graph and all of the interaction types are determined. Newton Rhapson integration was used to simulate the internal dynamics.",
